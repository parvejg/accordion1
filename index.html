        <p class="solution">
          TypeScript is referred to as an Object-oriented programming language;
          on the other hand, JavaScript is a prototype-based language.
          TypeScript offers static types mean variables, objects, and functions,
          whereas JavaScript doesn't require the explicit declaration of the
          variables before they're used.

        <p class="solution">
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
          documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
          document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
          document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
          interact with the page.

        <p class="solution">
          In React, state is a component-specific memory that stores and manages
          data that can change over time. It's a fundamental concept in React
          that allows components to remember information between renders and
          influences what is displayed on the user interface.

        <p class="solution">
          The main difference between a library and a framework in React JS is
          that a library provides predefined methods and classes to help
